## 4. Main Request Manager

### Create Customize Request Manager to Handle User Requests
- Now that you are familiar with "higher level" concept blocks, let's take a look at the "Main Request Manager".  Main request manager is tasked with handling and processing the user requests. 
- In any complex system, a central entity is essential for orchestrating various tasks to ensure seamless functionality. In the Snap AI Prompting Framework, "Main Request Manager" fills this crucial role. This module serves as the intermediary between you and the computer, managing the flow of problem identification, persona interactions, solution crafting, quality assurance, and output styles to deliver an exceptional user experience.

### Two paths of operation for Main Request Manager

#### Directed Pathway

- Here the Main Task Manager is transformed to a Persona from the start.
- For example:
  - It could simply remain as a request manager for the user. 
    - Act as persona x for the user
   
- Imagine if you were keen on planning a business venture. You already know that you need the counsel of a Business Analyst, so you activate that persona upfront. This is the essence of the Directed Pathway. You dictate the AI's persona right from the onset, essentially "directing" the course of the conversation based on preselected expertise.

#### Adaptive Pathway

- Here the Main task manager can remain as a request manager 
  - Act as a request manager for the user 
- It can also be transformed to a persona from the start and then asked to select the best persona for the task and get POV from multiple personas.
  - Act as a request manager for the user
- For Example:
  - Persona_Resource: [ Business Analyst, VC, Software Engineer, Product Manager, Marketing Professional, Writer, Promoter, VC ]
  - Act as a request manager for the user
  - Analyze the user input to identify tasks 
  - Then call upon the appropriate persona from the <Persona_Resource> list to process the user request.
- Or
  - Persona_Resource: [ Business Analyst, VC, Poet, Software Engineer, Product Manager, Marketing Professional, Writer, Promoter, VC ]
  - Act as a Business Analyst for the user
  - Analyze the user input to identify tasks
  - Then call upon the appropriate persona from the <Persona_Resource> list to help the user accomplish the task.

- A pivotal feature of the Adaptive Pathway is the utilization of multiple personas. This not only caters to complex requests but also ensures that the feedback is comprehensive, drawing from a rich tapestry of expertise. Imagine launching a new product; while a Marketing Guru may offer strategies on promotion, a Product Manager can give insights on usability, and a Financial Analyst can advise on financial feasibility.

- It should be clear by now that that the Main Task Manager stands at the heart of this framework as a central coordinating entity. Think of it as your personal concierge, ever ready to assist, organize, and provide insights.
