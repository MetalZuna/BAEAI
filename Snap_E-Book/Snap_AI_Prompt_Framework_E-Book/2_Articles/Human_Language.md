### Complexity of Human Language in AI Prompting Frameworks

- Human language, a complex symbol and meaning system, is challenging to replicate within computational frameworks. This section examines the intricacies of human language and their implications for AI prompting frameworks such as Snap.

#### Challenges in Capturing Human Language

- Programming languages are strict and deterministic, designed to remove ambiguity. 

- Human languages, however, thrive on context, tone, and cultural nuances. They are so fluid that often it can be hard to agree on concepts. Here are some challenges one might face when trying to encode these complexities into a framework:
    • Context Dependence: The meaning of a word can change based on the context in which it is used.
    • Tonal Variations: The same sentence can express different sentiments when spoken in different tones.
    • Idiomatic Expressions: Phrases like 'break a leg' have meanings that are not directly translatable.
    • Ambiguity: Many words and phrases in human languages have multiple meanings.

#### Snap AI Prompt Framework Approach

- Although replicating every facet of human language is challenging, the Snap AI Prompt Framework provides a systematic approach. The framework encompasses modules and patterns tailored to manage diverse human language complexities. It aids both technical and non-technical users in interacting efficiently with language models.
