are politicians the best people to trust with AI regulation??
perhaps, we have had nuclear weapons for a long time, and our political class has managed to not blow up the world. So perhaps they are the best people to trust with AI regulation. But then a quote from  retired general of the US army comes to mind, "that it's a miracle that we have not blown up the world yet" and as we speak the threat of nuclear war is closer than ever. So what is the solution? it certainly requires a thorough framework of governance. maybe we'll do a good job, maybe we won't, and maybe we'll get some things right and some things wrong. the answer will reveal itself in time. I am reminded of Anabasis. The display of democratic forces to resolve life threatening problems is absolutely remarkable. are we capable of such a feat? i hate to say it, but i don't think we are.
