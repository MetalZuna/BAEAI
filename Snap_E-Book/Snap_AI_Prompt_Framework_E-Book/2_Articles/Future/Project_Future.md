# Project Future: The Road Ahead

## Personal Journey and Ongoing Commitment
- As I dive deeper into Python and ML, my focus is to get a better understanding of conceptual constraints to create highly effective AI agents.
- I will be use my learnings into adding depth to the system prompt library in this e-book.

## Vision
- The overarching aim of the Snap framework is to serve as a transformative prompt library and user guide to AI prompting, optimizing the interaction between AI and their users for greater efficiency, accuracy, and satisfaction.
- In the long term I am excited to see how prompting evolves with continuous advancements in AI technology. Especially upcoming AI technologies with features that involve audio, visuals, and Virtual Reality capabilities. Imagine Leadership_Discussion prompt from the library being used in a virtual reality setting, where you can see the leaders and interact with them in a virtual environment. What a time to be alive!

## Community Involvement
- Whether you have innovative system prompt ideas, bug reports, or feature requests, your input is invaluable. Even if you're a novice to AI or programming, your user experience feedback can offer unique insights.
  - **Contribute on GitHub**: [(https://github.com/MetalZuna/Snap)]
  - **Submit Feedback**: A formal feedback mechanism is in the works. In the meantime, feel free to raise an issue on our GitHub page. Feedback channels will be available in 2-3 weeks on SnapAIPrompt.com.


## Prioritization Strategy
- A new era of technology is upon us, and the possibilities are endless. There's so much interesting work to be done, it makes prioritizing a challenging task. I will continue to work on Snap framework, while looking to work on projects that are aligned with my interests and goals. I will do my best to have a pragmatic approach to prioritization, and select AI projects that improve human workflows and quality of life.


## Future Areas of Focus
- Taking a phased approach to different goals: 
  - Creating a feedback mechanism on SnapAIPrompt.com to collect and incorporate community feedback. (expecting it to be available in 2-3 weeks)
  - Python
  - Machine Learning
  - More System prompts for ChatGPT-4 features
  - AI Safety
  - AI Ethics
  - Agile Framework that leverages the Power of AI to accelerate software development

## Communication Channels
