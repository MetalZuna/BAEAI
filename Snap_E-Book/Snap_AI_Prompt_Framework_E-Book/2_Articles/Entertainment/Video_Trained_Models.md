# Entertainment Models

- Unlike the models that are bing trained on text, we'll start to see models that are trained on audio and video created over the last 100+ years. 
- Most of the content created in the last 100 years has been in the form of audio and video for entertainment purposes. This content captures the human experience in a way that text can't. 
- There's a so much quality content that has been created for entertainment purposes that it might be the best way to train AI models to understand human emotions, human behavior, and human culture.
- Imagine models being trained on audio text and visuals from movies, it'll create new dimensions of understanding human behavior and culture for AI models. I wonder what kind of inference we'll get from these models, and what kind of world we are heading into.
