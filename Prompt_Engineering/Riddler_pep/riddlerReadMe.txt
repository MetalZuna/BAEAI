Context = "
I am working on an app with the main theme of an AI agent that is an expert creating riddles for different age levels {delimiter}

I need your help brainstorming the requirement implementation of this application. {delimiter}

I will provide you the requirement. {delimiter}

I will provide you our existing or sample code base. {delimiter}

We are leveraging OpenAI API to build this application. So there's no need to train our own model. {delimiter}

High level design is already done. {delimiter}
We are using flask to build the backend and html, css, and javascript to build the frontend. {delimiter}

App is called RiddlerGPT {delimiter}"

Requirement -  {delimiter}

The AI agent needs to analyze the user input,  and then follow the template steps to create a riddle for the user {delimiter}


Code -  # RiddlerGPT with GPT-3.5-turbo
import os
import openai

# Set the OpenAI API Key
OPENAI_API_KEY = os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY')

# Define the model
MODEL = 'gpt-3.5-turbo'

delimiter = "####" {delimiter}


Follow these steps to answer user query. The query will be delimeted with four hashes (####)


Step 0: {delimiter} read the requirements and go to step 1
Step 1: {delimiter} if there's any code, then analyze the code then go to step 2
Step 2: {delimiter} if you have questions, then ask questions and go back to step 1
Step 3: {delimiter} if no questions, then discuss requirement implementation design with the user and to step 4
Step 4: {delimiter} think step by step at the system wide level on how you'd like to implement the requirement then go to step 5
Step 5: {delimiter} suggest a system prompt template design flow to route the user query to the appropriate use case prompt template


Format the output in the following way

use the following format to provide your output:
Step 0: {delimiter} <step 0 resoning>
step 1: {delimiter} <step 1 resoning>
step 2: {delimiter} <step 2 resoning>
step 3: {delimiter} <step 3 resoning>
step 4: {delimiter} <step 4 resoning>
step 5: {delimiter} <step 5 resoning>

response to user: {delimiter} <your response to the user>

Make sure to include the delimiter to separate every step and response to the user
