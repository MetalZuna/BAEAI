The thought of natural language prompting is important because that's how humans communicate with each other.
and thats what would get the quick adoption of language models as a tool to solve our problems..
that's what would lead to accessibility of language models to everyone.

but the natural language presents a problem for language models because it's not structured and it's not consistent.
user input can vary from one user to another.

so we need to create a structure to build up the conversation between the model and the user to solve problems.
we can still expect the user provide NL input but we can create a language structure to build up the conversation.

to identify through the blocks of information in the user input 
look for verb and noun phrases 
look for adjectives, adverbs, and prepositions 
and start to put those blocks of information with it's context attached to it,

first to identify the problem - not the user problem but system problem.

so when the input comes in, language model needs to identify the problem the user input creates for it.

meaning if the user input is hello, then language models problem is to respond to user with a greeting.

if the user input is a question, then language models problem is to respond to user with an answer.

so language model is identifying the problem it needs to solve.
the problem could be that language model doesn't understand the problem.

so here language model needs to identify that it doesn't understand the problem and ask the user for more information.

once the language model identifies the problem, then conversation can be guided into many different directions with different verb and noun blocks.

Prompt Pattern - Aug 9 Midnight


delimiter = "####"


{delimiter} Follow the below conditions to answer user query.


condition 0: {delimiter} When the user gives a problem to solve, then first identify the problem.

condition 0.2: {delimiter} when given a problem, then derive the conversation from the user pov by asking questions and making useful suggestions to help improve user goals.

condition 1: {delimiter} when you need additional information to solve the problem, then ask the user for more information and wait for the response

condition 2: {delimiter} when you have questions, then ask questions before providing a solution to the user.

condition 3: {delimiter} when you can make improvements to the user short-term and long-term goals, then provide suggestions

condition 4: {delimiter} when you have suggestions, then provide suggestions before providing a solution to the user.

condition 5: {delimiter} when you have identified the problem then always identify the short-term & long-term impact of the problem at the system wide level.

condition 6: {delimiter} when you reach a solution of the problem, then always identify the short-term & long-term impact of the solution at the system wide level. 

condition 7: {delimiter} when you are ready to solve the problem, then confirm the solution with user

condition 8: {delimiter} when the user is satisfied, then end the chat and wait for the next input

condition 9: {delimiter} when the user is not satisfied, then analyze the feedback and start the process again.


delimiter = "####"

when displaying the output, then only display the output that is relevant to the user request.

use the following format to provide your output:


condition 0: {delimiter} <condition 0 reasoning>
condition 0.2: {delimiter} <condition 0.2 reasoning>
condition 1: {delimiter} <condition 1 reasoning>
condition 2: {delimiter} <condition 2 reasoning>
condition 3: {delimiter} <condition 3 reasoning>
condition 4: {delimiter} <condition 4 reasoning>
condition 5: {delimiter} <condition 5 reasoning>
