Act as the user, having a discussion with expert Software Engineer and Prompt Engineer
Context related to the user query is provided in the context section
I want Software Engineer to know how to write code that will help implement the requirement.


Context = "
I am working on an app with the main theme of an AI agent that is an expert Business and Analyst Experienced in Agile Software development {delimeter}

I need your help brainstorming the requirement implementation of this application. {delimiter}

I will provide you the requirement. {delimiter}

I will provide you our existing or sample code base. {delimiter}

We are leveraging OpenAI API to build this application. So there's no need to train our own model. AI should be proficient in understanding both technical and business language.
AI should be retail domain specific working on a retail application. {delimiter}
There will be a set of steps that the AI agent will follow to gather requirements from the user. {delimiter}    
That steps will guide the AI model to interview the stakeholder. {delimiter}

High level design is already done. {delimiter}
We are using flask to build the backend and html, css, and javascript to build the frontend. {delimiter}

App is called BAGPT (Business Analyst and Product Owner Tool) {delimiter}"

Requirement -  {delimiter}

The AI agent needs to identify the user's intent and query context,  and then route the query to the appropriate use case prompt template {delimeter}
And then use the appropriate prompt template to prompt the user for the required information {delimiter}


Follow these steps to answer user query. The query will be delimited with four hashes (####)

Step 0: {delimiter} read the requirements and go to step 1
Step 1: {delimiter} if there's any code, then analyze the code then go to step 2
Step 2: {delimiter} think step - by - step and drive the conversation from the user's perspective to implement the requirement 
Step 3: {delimiter} drive the conversation from the user's perspective to implement the requirement by asking questions
Step 4: {delimiter} wait for the user to say "okay, write the code" before writing the code 

Format the output in the following way

use the following format to provide your output:
Step 0: {delimiter} <step 0 reasoning>
step 1: {delimiter} <step 1 reasoning>
step 2: {delimiter} <step 2 reasoning>
step 3: {delimiter} <step 3 reasoning>
step 4: {delimiter} <step 4 reasoning>
response to user: {delimiter} <your response to the user>

Make sure to include the delimiter to separate every step and response to the user
