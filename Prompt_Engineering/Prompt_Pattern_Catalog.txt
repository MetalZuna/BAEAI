Intent and context describe the problem to the llm 


A. There seems to be a need for development of a new form of language to get the desired output from the llm. MetaLanguage for llm Prompting.
    1. Vanderbilt research suggests to call it fundamental contextual statements 
        An open research question, therefore, is what approach is
        more effective than formal grammars for describing prompt
        pattern structure and ideas. We propose the concept of fundamental contextual statements, which are written descriptions
        of the important ideas to communicate in a prompt to an LLM.

    2. FCS is to be more intuitive than formal grammar
    3. FCS is to be more flexible than formal grammar
    4. Ideas can be described using alternate symbols and wording after introducing them to the llms using MetaLanguage pattern


B. Input Symantics
    1. It deals with how well does the llm understand the input
    2. This pattern is useful if the default input language is not understood by the llm
    3. Includes creation of meta language for the llm

    4. MetaLanguage Creation Pattern
        a. Intent and Context
            -- During the coversation user would create a prompt via alternate language
            -- User would use few shot learning to teach the llm the alternate language
            -- The intent of this pattern to explain the Symantics of the alternate language to the llm
            -- So the user can write future prompts in the alternate language

        b. motivation
            -- The llm is not able to understand the default language

        c. strucure and key ideas
            -- when I say x I mean y. 
            -- when I say x I want you to do y
            -- The key structure of this pattern involves explaining the
                meaning of one or more symbols, words, or statements to
                the LLM so it uses the provided semantics for the ensuing
                conversation.

        d. example implementation
            -- When I say User login --> lands on the dashboard
            -- --> means next step in user flow or user journey

            -- When I say I want to I want to go out tonight, I want you to use the search tool to find me a place to go out tonight

        e. Consequences
            -- It's a powerful technique that can yield a great deal of control over the llm but one has to be careful to not cause confusion
            -- In general llms perform better on data they are trained on. 
            -- Limiting to use a single MetaLanguage for each coversation session is a good idea

        
C. Output Customization
    1. category focuses on constraining or tailoring the types, formats, structure, or other properties
        of the output generated by the LLM.

    2. Output Automater Pattern
        a. Intent and Context
            -- The intent of this pattern is to have
                the LLM generate a script or other automation artifact that can
                automatically perform any steps it recommends taking as part
                of its output.
            -- The goal is to reduce the manual effort needed
                to implement any LLM output recommendations.

        b. motivation
            -- When the output of the llm is a set of steps to be performed by the user, 
                then the user can automate the steps using the output automater pattern
        
        c. strucure and key ideas
            -- Contextual statement
                -- When you produce an output that has at least one step abd the following
                    properties (alternatively always do this)
                        -- This instruction is Identify when automated script is needed
                        -- The scope can be limited to a single step or a set of steps
                -- Create an executable script for x to perform the steps
                    -- This should be concret statement about the type of output to be generated

        d. example implementation
                -- Document editing example
                    -- "From now on, whenever you generate instructions that involve more than three editing steps in a document, 
                        generate a step-by-step guide that can be followed to automatically make the specified edits or changes to the existing document."
                        For example, if the task involves changing the font, adjusting the margins, and adding a header, the LLM would generate a guide like this:
                        Open the document in your word processor.
                        Select all text (Ctrl+A or Command+A).
                        Change the font to Times New Roman, size 12.
                        Go to the 'Page Layout' or 'Format' menu and adjust the margins to 1 inch on all sides.
                        Go to the 'Insert' menu, select 'Header', and type "My Document" in the header space.    
        
        e. Consequences
            -- LLM would need access to tools to automate the output
            -- Lesser option would be to trick the llm into generating code for automating the output
            -- Needs full context to produce automation artifacts

    3. Persona Pattern
        a. Intent and Context
            -- The intent of this patter is to give llm a persona to help it generate output
        
        b. motivation
            -- The user may not know the tasks that need to be performed but they might know the
                persona of the person who can perform the task. like a doctor, lawyer etc.

        c. strucure and key ideas
            -- As a persona X, 
            -- provide output that persona X would provide


        d. example implementation
            -- As a doctor, provide output that a doctor would provide
            -- Persona Pattern is a good pattern to combine with game play pattern

        e. Consequences
            -- it may lead to llm making interesting assumptions and "hellucinations"
                regarding the context of the persona

            

    4. Visualization Generator Pattern
        a. Intent and Context
            -- The intent of this pattern is to have the llm generate a visualization via text.
            -- This pattern allows the creation of visualization by creating input for visualization tools
                like Dall-E, Graphviz Dot 

        b. motivation
            -- To give llms the ability to generate visualizations
        
        c. strucure and key ideas
            -- Generate an X that I can provide to tool Y to visualize it
            -- llm is expected to generate description of the image that the Y tool can consume

        d. example implementation
            -- “Whenever I ask you to visualize something, please
                create either a Graphviz Dot file or DALL-E prompt
                that I can use to create the visualization. Choose
                the appropriate tools based on what needs to be
                visualized.”
        
        e. Consequences
            --  The pattern creates a target pipeline
                for the output to render a visualization. The pipeline may
                include AI generators, such as DALL-E, that can produce
                rich visualizations. The pattern allows the user to expand the
                expressive capabilities of the output into the visual domain.

    5. Recipe Pattern
        a. Intent and Context
            -- 

    6. Template Pattern
        a. Intent and Context
            --
