# Re-inventing hammer (I mean mouse)

- I was thinking about the future of human computer interaction, and I thought about a project to re-invent the mouse.

- Simplicity and Intuitive of mouse is what makes it so powerful.

- It's an extremely intuitive and efficient tool that is essentially an extension of our hand. it one of the most accessible tool we have ever created, this is like a hammer for the digital world.

- Despite all the advancements in construction tools, the hammer is still a must inside the toolbox, even though nails can be driven in with a nail gun. The hammer still gives you the finishing touch that a nail gun can't.
  
- So is it even possible to re-invent the mouse?, I am not sure how effective it would be, but it sounds like a fun project to work on.
