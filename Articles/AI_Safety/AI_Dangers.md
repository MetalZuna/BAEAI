# AI Entity

- Development of AI tools is causing a fear amongst the various groups, is it justified? I am not considering economic and social implications, but only the physical dangers of AI.

- AI tools don't have to be consciousness to present physical danger.

- Now, there's a software entity that can perform computer tasks. Once programmed, it can create and maintain understanding of self image and the world around it.
 It can access other computer programs to accomplish tasks. It can click buttons, fill out forms, check boxes, write emails, write code, browse the internet, imitate voices and images, create feedback loops to highlight just few capabilities.

- That sounds like something that requires a robust conversation about the realistic dangers of AI. The hype, fear mongering, and misinformation is damaging to the conversation, which there is a lot of.

- Now that it's becoming clear that OpenAI special sauce is quality data and compute scale. If further requirements are good programmers and mathematicians, then I encourage you to look at education systems globally. There are many centers of power around the world able to carry out the task to create these models.

- Perhaps we are getting close to the point where government will make it harder to get data and compute at scale. But then again, it's not that hard to get data and compute at scale if someone with access to resources really wants it.

- There is a legend about a King who made it illegal to have a negative thought about the King, but it's laughable to think that the rule can be enforced since we can't read thoughts. That's where this gets crazy, the AI tech of today gives it's handlers the ability to monitor and manipulate people and systems in ways that were not possible before. We are just at the tip of this tech, there is so much that is going to happen.

- Should we be worried? I am not sure. It is just the next thing in line of never ending transformations, at least we should have a conversation about it.
