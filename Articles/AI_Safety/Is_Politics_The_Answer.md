# Is Politics the answer to AI?

- Are politicians the best people to trust with AI regulation?

- Maybe or maybe not, but they will be the one to make the decisions.

- Thinking of that we have had nuclear weapons for a long time, and our political class has managed to not blow up the world. Perhaps they are the best people to trust with AI regulation. 

- Then a quote from  retired general of the US army comes to mind, "that it's a miracle that we have not blown up the world yet" and as we speak the threat of nuclear war is closer than ever. So maybe not. 

- I don't have the answers, but society needs to have a conversation about it. Politicians are the ones with platform that represents the people, and are responsible for the well being of the people. Naturally we look to them for answers.

- I am reminded of Anabasis. The display of democratic forces to resolve life threatening problems is absolutely remarkable. are we capable of such a feat? I would say, yes.

- So perhaps politicians will save us from the dangers of AI, just like they have saved us from dangers of other dangers.
