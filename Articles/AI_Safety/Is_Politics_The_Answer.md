# Is Politics the answer to AI?

- Are politicians the best people to trust with AI regulation?

- Well, it doesn't matter what we think, they will be the one regulating it.

- Thinking of that we have had nuclear weapons for a long time, and our political class has managed to not blow up the world. Perhaps they are the best people to trust with AI regulation. 

- Then a quote from  retired general of US Military comes to mind, "it's a miracle, that we have not blown up the world yet" and as we speak the threat of nuclear war is closer than ever. So maybe not. 

- I don't have the answers, but we should have a conversation about it. Politicians are the ones with platform that represents the people, and are responsible for the well being of the people. Naturally we look to them for providing an outlet for our concerns.

- I am reminded of Anabasis. The display of democratic forces to resolve life threatening problems is absolutely remarkable. are we capable of such feats? I would say, yes.

- So perhaps the answer to question posed earlier is, yes.
