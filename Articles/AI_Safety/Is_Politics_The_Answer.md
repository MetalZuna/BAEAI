# Is Politics the answer to AI?

- Are politicians the best people to trust with AI regulation?

- Maybe or maybe not.  

- Thinking of that we have had nuclear weapons for a long time, and our ruling class has managed to not blow up the world. Perhaps they are the best people to trust with AI regulation. 

- Then a quote from  retired general of the US army comes to mind, "that it's a miracle that we have not blown up the world yet" and as we speak the threat of nuclear war is closer than ever. So maybe not. 

- I don't have the answers, but society needs to have a conversation about it. Politicians are the ones with platform that represents the people, and are responsible for the well being of the people. Naturally we look to them for answers.

- I am reminded of Anabasis. The display of democratic forces to resolve life threatening problems is absolutely remarkable. are we capable of such a feat?
  

- But things are not that serious yet. We are not at the point where we need to worry about AI taking over the world, but that may change in the future.
