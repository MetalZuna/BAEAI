# Rethinking Electric Vehicle Design and Technology

- The electric vehicle (EV) industry has witnessed significant growth in recent years, driven mainly by increasing environmental concerns, and supportive government policies. EVs, once a niche market, are now seen as a key component in the transition to more sustainable transportation.

- This report aims to critically examine the current state of EV technology, with a focus on battery technology and vehicle design. It also explores the reasons behind the cautious approach of traditional automakers and the influence of social, political, and environmental factors on the EV market.

## Battery Technology in EVs
- Current EVs primarily use lithium-ion batteries, a technology that has seen gradual improvements but still faces significant limitations in terms of energy density, charging speed, and longevity. It's important to note that current battery tech has been around for decades.

- These challenges hinder the widespread adoption of EVs, as they impact the vehicle's range, maintenance cost, and overall user experience.

## Comparison with internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles
In comparison, ICE vehicles benefit from a mature technology with a well-established infrastructure, making them more convenient for long-range travel and quick refueling.

## Potential areas for technological breakthroughs
Significant advancements in battery technology are needed to overcome these limitations. Areas for potential breakthroughs include solid-state batteries, improved energy density, and faster charging technologies. But there has been little progress in these areas.

It seems like if it wasn't for political pressure to address climate change, there would be little reason to buy an EV. It's the growing concern over climate change and environmental sustainability has significantly influenced consumer attitudes, making EVs more appealing.

## Current Design doesn't make sense

- Let's take a look at the design of current EVs. They come with a lot of features that are not necessary for the function of the vehicle. For example, the infotainment system, automated doors, and other features that consume a lot of power.

- Why do we need door handles that pop out when you approach the vehicle? Why do we need a large infotainment system that consumes a lot of power? The range of the vehicle is limited by the battery capacity, so why not use that power for more important things?

- I tried to find out how much power is consumed by each unnecessary feature, and how would it impact the range of the vehicle if those features were removed. But I couldn't find any information on this topic. I would be very interested to see some data on this.
